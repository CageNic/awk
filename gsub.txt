# nullify (replace) the dash on first column
awk '{gsub(/-/,"",$1);print}' file

# replace CA with ca on first column
awk '{gsub(/CA/,"ca",$1);print}' file

# replace double space with single space on all columns
awk '{gsub("    "," ");print}' file

# same as... 
awk '{gsub("    "," ",$0);print}' file

# same as (instead of a semi colon separating the command and the print statement
# close the command with } so the command is in {} and have the print statement in its own {}
awk '{gsub("    "," ",$0)} {print}' file
